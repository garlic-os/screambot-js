**Development has moved to the C++ version: https://github.com/garlic-os/screambot**

# Screambot
A Discord bot that screams. That's it.

Screams when:
- Pinged
- Someone else screams
- Someone says something (sometimes)

## Run it yourself
### Run it on your own machine
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Fill in your `config.js`.
3. In a command line, do `npm install` then `npm start`.

## Thanks
I couldn't have done this without:
- Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
- discord.js and its documentation: https://discord.js.org/#/
- Inspiration and encouragement from friends and family
- node.js
- Viewers like you
  - Thank you
